# Data Types.
# Data Types are simply representations of real world data in a programming language.

# Examples of Real world data include
# - Numbers
# - Text
# - Date
# - Calendar, etc.,

# Examples of Real world data and their corresponding Data Types in Python
#   - Numbers 
#       - integers (int)
#       - decimals (float)
#   - Text 
#       - strings (str)
#   - Truth values / Booleans
#       -boolean (bool)

# Text/Strings (str)
"Wisdom"
'Fatima'
"I am a boy"

# Numbers/Integers (int)
18
25
32

# Numbers/Decimals (float)

# Truth Values/Booleans (bool)
True
False

# Variables.
# Variables are placeholders for storing values. They are containers that store values.

# Declaring variables
# variable_name = value
cgpa = 4.98
cgpa1 = 4.98
cgpa12 = 4.96


# Declaring Variable Conventions
# 1. Name your python variables using the snake case convention
# 2. Add a space after the variable name
# 3. Add an equal to (=) sign immediately after the space
# 4. Add another space after the equal to (=) sign
# 5. Finally write out the data to store inside the variable
# 6. Also note that the data / value which you intend to store inside the variable
#    must be a valid data type
my_friend = "Khadijat"
my_age = 25

# In the examples in line 46 and 47 above, the values after the variables are valid data types.
# If you pass in a value like "Khadijat" without the quotes, i.e.,
# my_friend = Khadijat
# This line above ðŸ‘† will give an error because Khadijat is not recognized as a valid data type
# Because without the quotes, python does not know that it is a string.


# Variable Naming Rules
# Variable Naming Rules are rules for naming variables which, if disobeyed,
# will cause a syntax error in the program

# 1. you must start with a letter
# 2. you cannot use any other symbols in your variable names except underscores(_)
# 3. you cannot use spaces in your variable names
myfriend = "Kifasi"
Myfriend = "Kifasi"
my1friend = "Kifasi"
MYFRIEND02 = "Kifasi"


# Variable Naming Conventions
# Snake Case: (Python Specific)
# 1. All the letters in your variables must be small letters
# 2. separate words with underscores (_)
my_friend = "Kifasi"

# Camel Case: (Other Programming Languages)
# 1. Write the first word in the variable with small letters
# 2. Start subsequent words with their first letters capitalized
myFriend = "Kifasi"
isHeLying = True

# Pascal Case: (classes specific)
# 1. Write all the words in the variable with their first letters capitalized
MyFriend = True


# Constant Case: (Python specific)
# 1. All the words are written in Capital letters
# 2. The words are separated by underscores (_)
FRIEND_FOR_LIFE = "Kifasi"

# Functions.
# Functions are defined as a bunch or block of code that is designed to perform a specific task
#   1. built-in functions
#   2. imported functions
#   3. user-defined functions


# print statement
# function_name(input_of_some_form)
